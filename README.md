# Guild Wars Sealed Deck Generator

Pet project for creating a randomized pool of skills (a sealed deck) to create builds from.

### Personal Skill Blacklist Ideas

Philosophy: Blacklisting skills is mostly for exceptionally strong skills that provide value unconditionally. Since "meta" hero builds tend to abuse these kinds of 
skills the most (eg. mesmers), blacklisting is better off focusing more towards hero builds than player builds. Player builds tend to rely more on synergies between 
skills (ie. "conditionally strong" skills), so the random nature of the sealed deck will tend to "break" meta player builds anyways.

Always ban: Meta-defining, unequivocally strong skills
```
"Save Yourselves!"
Blood is Power
Energy Surge
Great Dwarf Weapon
Ineptitude
Panic
Power Drain
Soul Twisting
Spirit Light
Splinter Weapon
```

Sometimes ban: Skills that are good on almost any bar; skills that make a bad bar good
```
"Finish Him!"
"Together as One!"
"You Move Like a Dwarf!"
Cry of Frustration
Heroic Refrain
Seven Weapon Stance
Signet of Spirits
Mistrust
Wandering Eye
```
